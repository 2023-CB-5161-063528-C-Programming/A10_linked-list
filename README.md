# A10: Linked List

Implement following finctions in `list.c`:

* Append element to the end of the list `List l_append(List list, int value);`
* Insert element to the list at the given position `List l_insert_to(List list, int index, int value);`
* Insert element into the already sorted list to keep it sorted sorting `List l_insert_keep_sorting(List list, int value);`

Then add a code to `main` to make sure all of them work.
